💖 Thanks for opening this pull request! 💖
      
      
        
      
      
        
  We use [semantic commit messages](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) to streamline the release process. Before your pull request can be merged, you should **update your pull request title** to start with a semantic prefix.
      
      
        

      
      
        
  Examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:
      
      
        

      
      
        
  - `fix: don't overwrite prevent_default if default wasn't prevented`
      
      
        
  - `feat: add app.isPackaged() method`
      
      
        
  - `docs: app.isDefaultProtocolClient is now available on Linux`
      
      
        

      
      
        
  Things that will help get your PR across the finish line:
      
      
        

      
      
        
  - Follow the JavaScript, C++, and Python [coding style](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/coding-style.md).
      
      
        
  - Run `npm run lint` locally to catch formatting errors earlier.
      
      
        
  - Document any user-facing changes you've made following the [documentation styleguide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/styleguide.md).
      
      
        
  - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
      
      
        
  - Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible.
